# Your Question
```
In as simple and clear a language as you can, say why you opened up this issue.
Please try to be respectful, and detailed. Provide enough context that the maintainers can understand.
e.g. 
For example: I noticed you said you used Elm-ui for styling vs Elm-css. What was the reason for this decision? I want to contribute on this project but I only 
know elm-css? Is that possible to be added to the application?
```

# Helpful Resources
```
Include any documents, images, tutorials, etc that can help provide clarity for the question being asked.
e.g.
Here's a link to some work I've done using elm-css
I can see here in the documentation where you have the option of choosing layout styles. 
```

# Collaborators 
```
Include anyone who may be relevant to the discussion
